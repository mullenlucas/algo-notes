1071. ## Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "`t` divides `s`" if and only if `s = t + ... + t` (i.e., `t` is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return *the largest string* `x` *such that* `x` *divides both* `str1` *and* `str2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
**Output:** "ABC"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
**Output:** "AB"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
**Output:** ""

## Explanation

1. #### Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
   
   ```python
   def gcd(a, b):
       while b:
           a, b = b, a % b
       return a
   ```

The `gcd(a, b)` function is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. The function `gcd(a, b)` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input.

2. It enters a `while` loop that continues until `b` becomes zero. The loop performs the following steps in each iteration:
   
   a. It updates the values of `a` and `b` in a single line using tuple unpacking and the modulo operator (`%`).
   
   b. The variable `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`.
   
   For example, if `a = 21` and `b = 15`, after one iteration, `a` becomes `15` and `b` becomes `21 % 15`, which is `6`.
   
   This step is the key to the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm is based on the key observation that 
   
   **the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. It continues to update `a` and `b` in this way until `b` becomes zero.**
   
   ```python
   GCD(n1,n2) = GCD(>n + <n % >n)
   ```

3. Once `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates, and the function returns the value of `a`.

4. The value returned by the function is the GCD of the original input values `a` and `b`.

The function is simple yet powerful and provides an efficient way to find the GCD of two integers. It is widely used in various mathematical and computational applications where the GCD is required. In the context of finding the largest string that divides both `str1` and `str2`, we use this `gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of the lengths of the two strings.

We find the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2` because any common divisor of the two strings must also divide their lengths. For example, if `str1` has a length of 6, and `str2` has a length of 12, any common divisor of 6 and 12 must also be a valid divisor for both `str1` and `str2`.

2. #### Extract a substring of length equal to the GCD from both `str1` and `str2`.
   
   After obtaining the GCD, we extract substrings of length equal to the GCD from both `str1` and `str2`. These substrings represent parts of the original strings that have lengths divisible by the GCD. If there exists a common divisor of `str1` and `str2`, it should be a substring of both extracted substrings.

3. #### Compare the two substrings.
   
   If they are equal, then this substring is the largest string that divides both `str1` and `str2`. Otherwise, remove one character from the end of the substring and repeat the comparison until a common divisor is found.

```python
def largest_common_divisor_string(str1, str2):
    len1, len2 = len(str1), len(str2)
    gcd_len = gcd(len1, len2)

    # Extract substrings of length gcd_len
    substring1 = str1[:gcd_len]
    substring2 = str2[:gcd_len]

    # Check if the substrings are equal
    while substring1 != substring2:
        # Reduce the length of the substrings
        gcd_len -= 1
        substring1 = str1[:gcd_len]
        substring2 = str2[:gcd_len]

    return substring1
```
